Your minimum requirements for this project are to build a Command Line App that:

Contains at least three models with corresponding tables, including a join table.
Accesses a Sqlite3 database using ActiveRecord.
Has a CLI that allows users to interact with your database as defined by your user stories (minimum of four; one for each CRUD action).
Uses good OO design patterns. You should have separate models for your runner and CLI interface.
